# Lab 5: JavaScript

In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to examine form validation and create a node highlighter helper with JavaScript.  Detailed instructions follow.  Review the marking rubric to ensure you have addressed all points required for the page.  Ensure you keep a version on your pages under version control as it may be used in subsequent weeks.  You do not need to use a webserver to host your page for this lab.  **Do not modify the HTML code.  You will need to inspect the source code to determine how to link your JavaScript to the page**.
